            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF <hi>Aſſurances as they now Stand:</hi> And the Evil Conſequences thereof to the Nation.</head>
            <p>MOST Nations have Laws, That no Aſſurance on any Ship or Goods ſhall be Recoverable, but where the Aſſured run 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Adventure, Reckoning the <hi>Praemium</hi> part of the Adventure: And when the Aſſurance was made in time, before the Aſſured could poſſibly have any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Ships being Loſt, by Poſt or Expreſs, Reckoning 4 Miles <hi>per</hi> Hour for the bringing the News; Whereas in <hi>England</hi> the Aſſured can Recover 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and more, having the Value of 20 <hi>s.</hi> Goods, or very inconſiderable part in the Ship, which is a great Encouragement for the Loſing of Ships on purpoſe, and the Loſing Mens Lives and Eſtates: Whereas were it Enacted, That all Merchants and others, ſhould run the 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of their Adventure, the Sum not exceeding 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on greater Sums; Theſe Frauds would entirely be Prevented, the Shipping well ſet to Sea, and Trading Encouraged.</p>
            <p>Whereas there is room left in Blank Policys for the Aſſureds Name, the Burthen of the Ship, Number of the Guns and Men; It's very often that there is Borrowed Names put in, as the Aſſured, which are not ſo, and the Burthen of the Ship, and Number of the Guns and Men left out, and reported to be much Bigger, and greater Force than they are; by which the Aſſurer is Deceived. For, Whereas were it Enacted, That the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, ſhould put his own Name in the Policy, or the Name for whom he makes ſuch Aſſurance, if by Commiſſion, the Burthen of the Ship, Number of the Guns and Men; And that every Ship Lanched ſhould continue her Name, without Changing it, and the Ships the ſame Names they now go by, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Abuſes would be Prevented.</p>
            <p>That no Endorſement on a Policy may be allowed good, but what is made before News of the Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Loſt, either to return a <hi>Praemium</hi> or Pay a Loſs.</p>
            <p>To Prevent the great Abuſes daily Impoſed in Aſſurances, by Averages; That no Average be lyable to be Recovered by Liquids, for Leakage or Periſhable Goods; unleſs it appear that by Violence of the Storm the Ship has Loſt her Maſt, and had her Decks broke, or Goods flung over Board, by extraordinary Violence of Weather; And that a Legal Survey be made of the ſame, by the <hi>Trinity-Houſe</hi> at Home, and Authentick Certificates from our Conſuls or Agents abroad.</p>
            <p>That diſtinct Policys be made, what Aſſured on Ship, and what on Goods.</p>
            <p>That whereas there has been very great Abuſes put on the Aſſurer, by Old and Decayed Ships, ſent for <hi>Africa,</hi> and other Parts, where the Worms eat them, where after having made great Aſſurances on the Ships here, they have detained them in Ports on purpoſe, ſo long till their Bottoms have been eaten up, or at leaſt ſo as not fit to go to Sea; whereby they have got a Survey and Atteſtation thereof, and ſo Recovered their Loſs: Whereas in Reaſon no Loſs can be juſtly Demanded, where 'tis through the Inſufficiency of the Ship, and through the Owners Faults in Detaining her ſo long, to Incapacitate her to proceed her Voyage, and when the ſaid Ship Remains caſt in the Poſſeſſion of their Maſter: Whereby it is hoped, 'twill be found Reaſonable, the Aſſurer ſhall be freed from the Loſs, if occaſioned by the Inſufficiency of the Ship, or by the Worm by long lying.</p>
            <p>That whereas oftentimes Ships are Loſt, and Goods Saved, or great part of them, when in Reaſon the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ought for the Benefit of the Aſſures, to take care of the Saving and Diſpoſing of the ſame, the Aſſurers allowing the Charge, they now pretend being over and fully Aſſured, to Renounce to the Aſſures, who being ſo many ſeveral People, come to great Loſs thereby; Whereas were the Aſſured obliged to take care of his own Salvages, and the Aſſurers to make good the Remainder of the Loſs of their Subſcriptions, there would be a great deal Saved thereby, and the Aſſured no Loſer.</p>
